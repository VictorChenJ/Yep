 USA_airbases_close_to_japan:0 "Airbases close to Japan"
 USA_airbases_close_to_japan_desc:0 "Instead of having to rely on long, ardous and risky flights to Japan.

They have sown the divine wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind."
 USA_procure_the_defeat_of_japan:0 "Procure the Defeat of Japan"
 USA_procure_the_defeat_of_japan_desc:0 "We stand united, to secure the defeat of Japan at the hands of the Allies, in which China is of course included. The Empire of the Rising Sun shall set in the shade of the Giant that they have awoken."
 USA_procure_equipment_through_other_means:0 "Procure Equipment for China"
 USA_procure_equipment_through_other_means_desc:0 "Due to the nature of popular support for war and armaments production in America, it is impossible for us to send our own weapons to the Chinese.

 USA_X_force:0 "Create the X Force"
 USA_X_force_desc:0 "With our advisors in place, and alot of our equipment and money floating in China we have considerable influence over the nationalist government. Thereby it is not improper to suggest to Chiang Kai Shek that we help train divisions for him, granted we supply them with our own equipment."
 USA_lost_but_not_forgotten:0 "Lost, But Never Forgotten"
 USA_lost_but_not_forgotten_desc:0 "Although China might have fallen in its struggle against Japan, the United States of America does not recognize the reorganized government which is a puppet state created by Japan.

 USA_fund_the_guerillas:0 "Fund Chinese Resistance"
 USA_fund_the_guerillas_desc:0 "The Chinese population lives under oppression and Japanese cruelty, but there exists a spark, and a flame which we can help ignite by helping the resistance grow stronger and more well organized.

 USA_spawn_pershing:0 "Revenge of the Tanks"
 USA_spawn_pershing_desc:0 ""
 USA_new_deal_2:0 "Second New Deal"
 USA_new_deal_2_desc:0 "Although the economy has begun to rise since the tragedy of 1929, there is more work to be done. Millions remain unemployed, and radicals have begun to criticize FDR for not going far enough. His answer to this was the Second New Deal, a bundle of policies aimed specifically at alleviating the damages done by the Depression."
 USA_construction_1:0 "Farm Security Administration"
 USA_construction_1_desc:0 "The successor to the Resettlement Administration, the FSA was a program designed to emphasize the challenges of rural poverty and worked to alleviate its effects through generous spending and purchase of land."
 USA_construction_2:0 "National Labour Relations Act"
 USA_construction_2_desc:0 "The NLRA, also known as the Wagner Act, is the foundation of American labor law and fully legalizes trade unions under the principle of collective bargaining.

 USA_construction_5:0 "Social Security Act"
 USA_construction_5_desc:0 "The bank crash has left its mark upon the elderly of America above all others. An unprecedented amount of retirement funds have been lost to the market, leaving many without the means to live. To prevent a repeat of this issue, the Social Security Act will impose a tax upon all individuals earning income, which will then be issued to those in retirement. It is in this way we may save prior generations from bearing our errors."
 USA_landon_deal:0 "Landon's Deal"
 USA_landon_deal_desc:0 "One of the New Deal's most influential supporters is, ironically enough, Alf Landon himself. Criticizing some portions of the policies, he also supported many more instances of New Deal legislation. Landon's Deal will bring out what the New Deal is meant to be, without any of the dangerous radicalism Roosevelt included."
 USA_labour_management:0 "Labour-Management Relations Act"
 USA_labour_management_desc:0 "Labor unions wield unprecedented power in the workforce, though clearly not for the better. We must limit the unfair labor practices of unions and ensure the balance of power and order in corporate society."
 USA_business_ties:0 "Business Ties"
 USA_business_ties_desc:0 "Among Landon's chief supporters are large businesses, believing that FDR's policies were far too union-favored. Landon's election means prosperity for corporations, and we cannot let them forget that."
 USA_standard_oil:0 "Standard Oil of California"
 USA_standard_oil_desc:0 "Rarely does one see an oil baron as president, but that is exactly what has occurred. We cannot let this opportunity go to waste, for influence is useful, regardless of how it may be attained."
 USA_gold_standard:0 "Reaffirm the Gold Standard"

 USA_tackle_waste_desc:0 "In times of trouble, the populace must be conscious of all usage, no matter how small. The American people are industrious, it should be no trouble to reduce waste in the short-term."
 USA_denounce_neutrality:0 "Denounce Neutrality"
 USA_denounce_neutrality_desc:0 "The United States of America has always stood as the defender of liberty, regardless of borders or affiliation. We cannot discard this notion simply because of a recession. The American people will fight on!"
 USA_tax_reform:0 "Tax Reform"
 USA_tax_reform_desc:0 "The income tax has been a disaster in the long run, and has far outlived its purpose. Siphoning much-needed revenue from household families is simply immoral. By reinstituting certain tariffs and excise taxes, we can lower the tax rates on individuals."
 USA_the_sherman:0 "The Sherman"
 USA_the_sherman_desc:0 "The M4 Sherman has proven itself to be a very capable and versatile vehicle. Our production efforts should be focused on improving the quality and quantity of it's manufacturing process."
 USA_hello_to_ford:0 "Say Hello to Ford..."
 USA_hello_to_ford_desc:0 "The American automotive industry was by far the largest in world. We should use this massive car making idustry to outfit our troops with modern fighting vehicles and transports."
 USA_douglas_c47:0 "Douglas C-47"
 USA_douglas_c47_desc:0 "The C-47 differed from the civilian DC-3 in numerous modifications, including being fitted with a cargo door, hoist attachment, and strengthened floor, along with a shortened tail cone for glider-towing shackles, and an astrodome in the cabin roof."
 USA_race_for_rubber:0 "Race for Rubber"
 USA_race_for_rubber_desc:0 "Production of synthetic rubber in the United States expanded greatly during World War II since the Axis powers controlled nearly all the world's limited supplies of natural rubber by mid-1942. By 1944, a total of 50 factories were manufacturing it, pouring out a volume of the material twice that of the world's natural rubber production before the beginning of the war."
 USA_victory_plan:0 "Implement The Victory Plan"
 USA_victory_plan_desc:0 "In 1941, a team of officers led by General Albert Wedemeyer on behalf of General George C. Marshall drew up the Victory Program, whose premise was that the Soviet Union would be defeated that year, and that to defeat Nazi Germany would require the United States to raise by the summer of 1943 a force of 215 divisions comprising 8.7 million men."
